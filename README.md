# Accessible game control research 
Increasingly more products and services are designed with disability in mind and have improved beyond becoming more accessible. But while we are working towards more accessibility there is still a lot of room for improvement in gaming accessibility. To contribute towards improving gaming accessibility I have researched accessible game controls and made a short demo in Unreal Engine V4.18.3 with a speech control option. Players can experience a form of control that is difficult for them but could be accessible for people with physical disabilities. I made this project for an open choice school assignment.
